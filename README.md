# AutoVessel

THİS PROJECT İS FULLY DIY AND OPEN SO YOU CAN ACCSESS ALL THE FİLES DOWN BELOW

 This is an application for remote controller for the ship (tekne1.8) that i made. By this application all my rc ship is converted to a autonomous vessel.
I made it by setting checkpoints to the map and the alghoritm of the main code finds out which way that ships have to turn its direction and it goes direcly 
that checkpoint. After that it goes for his new checkpoint.

This is the rc ship that i design:
